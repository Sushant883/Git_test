            <p class="para">Juice is a refreshing and nutritious beverage made from extracting the liquid of fruits,
                vegetables, or herbs. It is an excellent source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, providing
                numerous health benefits such as boosting immunity and aiding digestion. Freshly made juice is hydrating
                and can help detoxify the body. Whether it's a simple orange juice or a complex green juice blend, itâ€™s
                a delicious way to enjoy the goodness of nature. Drinking juice regularly can contribute to maintaining
                a balanced and healthy diet.</p>
