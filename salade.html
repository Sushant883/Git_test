            <p>A salad is a versatile dish made with a combination of raw or cooked vegetables, fruits, proteins, nuts,
                and seeds, often dressed with a flavorful dressing. The base of a salad is usually made up of leafy
                greens like lettuce, spinach, or kale, providing a fresh and nutritious foundation. Other common
                ingredients include cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, and bell peppers, which add crunch, color, and
                vitamins. Salads can also include proteins like grilled chicken, tofu, or beans, making them a more
                filling meal. They are often dressed with a variety of options, from light vinaigrettes to creamy
                dressings, depending on taste preferences. Salads are not only delicious but also offer numerous health
                benefits, as they are rich in essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, which support
                overall well-being. With endless variations, salads can be customized to suit different dietary needs
                and preferences, making them a popular choice for a light, healthy meal or side dish.</p>
