            <p>Bruschetta is a classic Italian appetizer known for its simplicity, fresh ingredients, and vibrant
                flavors. It traditionally consists of grilled or toasted slices of bread rubbed with garlic, then topped
                with a variety of fresh ingredients, the most popular being tomatoes, olive oil, and basil. The bread is
                usually brushed with extra virgin olive oil before grilling, which gives it a rich, crisp texture. The
                tomatoes used are often diced and mixed with olive oil, fresh basil leaves, and sometimes balsamic
                vinegar, creating a refreshing and flavorful topping.</p>

            <p>Bruschetta is believed to have originated in Italy during the 15th century as a way for olive growers to
                taste their freshly pressed olive oil. Over time, it evolved into a dish that can be customized with a
                variety of toppings such as mozzarella cheese, prosciutto, mushrooms, or roasted peppers. The dish is
                served as an antipasto (starter) and is widely loved for its balance of crunchy bread and juicy,
                flavorful toppings.</p>
