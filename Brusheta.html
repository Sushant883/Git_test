    <div class="paracontainer">
        <p class="p1">Recipe of Brusheta: Bruschetta is a traditional Italian dish that dates back to ancient Rome, originally
            created as a way to salvage stale bread. It is typically made by toasting slices of bread, then rubbing them
            with garlic and topping them with fresh, high-quality ingredients like tomatoes, olive oil, and basil.</p>

        <p class="p2">The word "bruschetta" comes from the Italian verb bruscare, meaning "to toast" or "to char," which refers to
            the method of grilling or toasting the bread before adding toppings. While the classic version is
            tomato-based, variations can include different toppings such as mozzarella, prosciutto, roasted vegetables,
            or even seafood.</p>
